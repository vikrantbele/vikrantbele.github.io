    <p>### Why do we exist??

Does someone even have an answer that seems promising?
I don't think so and It's far more better to accept it 
that we do not know it rather than assuming something.

One of the key property which differentiates us from the
non-living things is our brain/intelligence


Then what is this intelligence? I guess the ability to 
take some actions according to the information we have.
[aka Problem solving]


Can problem solving be mimicked? I won't be able to say
a firm no to it. I think even if we are not able to 
achieve 100% of it. Some time in future, it would saturate
 over 99.9999%.


Biologically, what are we? just very complex system comprised
of thousands of more complex systems.[ Digestive system, 
respiratory system, nervous system]


what are these complex system are made of? Organs, again
the complex system of different cells which share some
common behaviour.


What are organs made of? mostly cells, again of system of 
smaller substructures like DNA, chromosomes, mitochondria etc.


What are these structures made of maybe some bio-material
like proteins, chemicals, elements, etc.


It boils down to ultimately to the same thing as non living
matter.[ I think it's very close to 'HEAP OF SAND PARADOX']
It's very difficult to say when some matter is non-living and 
add more complexity to it and where it becomes living.
[e.g. Difference DNA protein and an amoeba ]


Now the question comes what are these chemicals? why do they
react with the environment or with each other? may be 
because they have their own properties. Why do they have 
different properties? Because they have different chemical
formulations[atoms]. Does that mean however atoms behave 
is due to the fact that there is different charge on particles.
I don't know maybe.[That's the only valid answer I could find]

Then why do (+) and (-) charge are exits? Why do they attract
each other? That's where my exploration is capped as of now.

When the day comes where we are able to tell this thing why do
positive and negative charge exist and why it attracts the
opposite, then we may get one step closer to find why do
we even exist...[continue thinking]
